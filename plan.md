# planning creation of chess game

- creating game straight from pygame, no terminal stuff needed

- using object oriented paradigm
    - one class for a general piece, and inheriting from that for each individual piece
    - one class for the board

# TODO and updates: (add updates here after each session)
- moved loadfromfen to piece.py
- need to finish loadfromfen
